            "witness": "Well, Mr. Chairman, my personal view is that a biological threat and a chemical threat is\n            of a kind with a nuclear threat. And he has biological and chemical weapons. And he is aggressively pursuing\n            nuclear weapons. The region knows that. The region knows this man very, very well. And they are frightened\n            of him.\n            And I don't know precisely what it would do to the balance in the region for it to be demonstrated that he\n            has a nuclear capability and the ability to deliver it, not just to his neighbors, but to others.\n            In my view, the thing that is critical in the region is the role that the coalition forces have played since\n            Desert Storm to dissuade him from invading his neighbors.",

            "question": " Whenever a controversy like this arises, there is always a danger that Congress' response will be to step in and overregulate. \n        Now, that has been the experience that I have had in my 42 years here. In your view, what sorts of legislative changes would help to solve the \n        problems the Cambridge Analytica story has revealed, and what sorts of legislative changes would not help to solve this issue? ",
            "witness": " Senator, I think that there are few categories of legislation that make sense to consider. Around privacy specifically, \n        there are few principles that I think it would be useful to discuss and potentially codify into law. One is around having a simple and practical \n        set of ways that you explain what you are doing with data. And we talked a little bit earlier around the complexity of laying out this long privacy \n        policy. It is hard to say that people, you know, fully understand something when it is only written out in a long legal document. The stuff needs to \n        be implemented in a way where people can actually understand it, where consumers can understand it but that can also capture all the nuances of how \n        these services work in a way that is not overly restrictive on providing the services. That is one.\n    The second is around giving people complete control. This is the most important principle for Facebook. Every piece of content that you share on Facebook \n    you own, and you have complete control over who sees it and how you share it. And you can remove it at any time. That is why every day, about 100 billion \n    times a day, people come to one of our services and either post a photo or send a message to someone because they know that they have that control and that \n    who they say it is going to is who sees the content. And I think that that control is something that is important that I think should apply to every service.",
